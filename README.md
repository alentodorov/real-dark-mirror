# This is a weird app

This app uses ChatGPT 3.5 API and your markdown diary to be able answer questions about yourself.

Install using these steps
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
export OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key
update name variable in main.py to your name
update folder_path to your Markdown files 
```
After, just update the `prompt` var to ask yourself something.
